# Achievements
This is a mock app that is not quite complete that I built to introduce myself to coding in Swift.
The basic concept of the app is a social-media app that allows you to send instant notifications of 
"achievements" to specific groups of friends, similar to how you would get an achievement notification
on videogame consoles. In its current state, the Achievements app has the ability to create an account
and post from the created user. There is also a working feed that has all prior posts in chronological order.
This project used Swift and SwiftUI for the frontend and Firebase's Firestore as the backend.
Obviously, the project is nowhere near polished and complete, but as an introduction to the language and as
a way to link a frontend created by Swift with a backend, it was a well-used opportunity.

Here's an example of how the feed would look:
